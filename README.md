# Github Repos

Simple Rails 5.2 app that will search repositories on Github in the V3 of their API.

### Notes:

I intentionally didn't use the Github's official gem [octokit](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb) because I wanted to have an excuse to use [WeCall](https://github.com/wework/we-call-gem).

YAGNI and KISS principles, as an educational 'refresher' of using Rails rendering HTML views.
